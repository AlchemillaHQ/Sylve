Sylve aims to be a lightweight, open-source virtualization platform for FreeBSD, leveraging Bhyve for VMs and Jails for containerization, with deep ZFS integration. It seeks to provide a streamlined, Proxmox-like experience tailored for FreeBSD environments. It's backend is written in Go and the frontend is written in Svelte (with Kit).

# Development Requirements

These only apply to the development version of Sylve, the production version will be a single binary.

- Go >= 1.24
- Node.js (v20.18.2)
- NPM (v10.9.2)

# Runtime Requirements

Sylve is designed to run on FreeBSD 14.3 or later, and it is recommended to use the latest version of FreeBSD for the best experience.

## Dependencies

Running Sylve is pretty easy, but sylve depends on some packages that you can install using `pkg` or the corresponding port to that package. Here's a list of what you'd need:

| Dep            | Min. version | Vendored | Optional | Purpose                                          |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| smartmontools  | 7.4_2        | No       | No       | Disk health monitoring                           |
| tmux           | 3.2          | No       | No       | Terminal multiplexer, used for the (web) console |
| libvirt        | 11.1.0       | No       | No       | Virtualization API, used for Bhyve               |
| bhyve-firmware | 1.0_2        | No       | No       | Collection of Firmware for bhyve                 |
| samba419       | 4.19.9_9     | No       | No       | SMB file sharing service                         |
| jansson        | 2.14.1       | No       | No       | JSON library for C                               |

We also need to enable some services in order to run Sylve, you can drop these into `/etc/rc.conf` if you don't have it already:

```sh
ntpd_enable="YES" # Optional
ntpd_sync_on_start="YES" # Optional
zfs_enable="YES"
linux_enable="YES" # Optional
libvirtd_enable="YES"
dnsmasq_enable="YES"
rpcbind_enable="YES"
nfs_server_enable="YES"
mountd_enable="YES"
samba_server_enable="YES"
```

And these into `/boot/loader.conf`:

```sh
cryptodev_load="YES"
zfs_load="YES"
vmm_load="YES"
nmdm_load="YES"
if_tap_load="YES"
if_bridge_load="YES"
hw.vmm.iommu.passthrough=1
```

Please reboot your system after adding those entries to ensure that the services are started correctly and the kernel modules are loaded.
