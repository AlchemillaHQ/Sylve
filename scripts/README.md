# Scripts

These are some cool scripts that we've written to make our life easier.

## add_license.sh

This script adds a license to all files (.go and .ts specifically), this skips .svelte files as they are not supported yet.

## check_deps.sh

This script checks if all dependencies are installed and ready for use.

## generate_swagger.sh

This script generates a swagger file from the go code. This is useful for generating API documentation.

### License

Please see the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file for more information.
