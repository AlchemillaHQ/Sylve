# Sylve Code of Conduct

Alchemilla, and by extension the Sylve team, has always worked to foster a welcoming and respectful community. As we grow and evolve, we want to ensure that this remains unchanged. To that end, we have established a few ground rules that we ask all participants to adhere to:

## **Our Principles**

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that embraces and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion (or lack thereof), and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by others, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will impact users and colleagues. Keep those consequences in mind. Remember, we are a global community, and not everyone communicates in the same primary language.
- **Be respectful.** Not everyone will always agree, but disagreements are no excuse for poor behavior or bad manners. Frustration may arise, but it should never result in personal attacks. A community where individuals feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Sylve community should remain respectful when engaging with others, both within and outside of the community.

## **Respectful Communication**

- **Be mindful of your words and be kind to others.** Do not insult or demean fellow participants. Harassment and exclusionary behavior are unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Violent threats or language directed at another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Doxxing (posting or threatening to post others' personally identifiable information).
  - Personal insults, especially those based on race, gender, or other protected attributes.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Encouraging or advocating for any of the above behavior.

- **If someone asks you to stop, then stop.** Continuing such behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.

## **Handling Disagreements**

- **Seek to understand different perspectives.** Disagreements—whether social or technical—are inevitable. However, it is essential to resolve them constructively.
- **Recognize our diversity.** The strength of Sylve lies in its diverse community, comprising individuals from various backgrounds. Differing perspectives are natural, and not understanding someone’s viewpoint does not mean they are wrong.
- **Acknowledge that mistakes happen.** Being human means making mistakes. Instead of placing blame, focus on resolving issues and learning from them.

## **Scope of This Code of Conduct**

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Sylve project. This includes but is not limited to:

- Online chat channels
- Mailing lists
- Bug trackers
- Sylve events (e.g., developer meetings, social gatherings)
- Any other official forums used for communication within the community

It applies to all forms of communication within these spaces, including emails, messages, presentations, videos, posters, signs, or even clothing displayed in these environments.

Additionally, in rare cases, behavior outside these spaces may affect a person’s ability to participate within them if it constitutes an egregious violation of this Code of Conduct.

## **Reporting Violations**

If you believe someone is violating this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it by emailing [conduct@alchemilla.io](mailto:conduct@alchemilla.io).
